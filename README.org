** What is Hyperscheduling
#+begin_quote
Hyperscheduling is the idea of fully planning your day using a calendar. Every minute of the day is assigned to some task using a calendar.

** What does org-hyperscheduler do?

org-hyperscheduler presents a web UI that allows agenda entries to be visualized and moved around easily.


Here's a typical agenda

and here is how it's visualized in org-hyperscheduler

[[file:images/org-hs-ui.png]]

- blue entries are coming from an external calendar (such [[https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el][org-gcal]]).
- purple entries are part of standard org-agenda


The user is free to modify entries or move them around provided =org-hyperschedule-readonly-mode= is disabled.

** Planning a day

When planning a day, it's easy to start with a list of tasks:
